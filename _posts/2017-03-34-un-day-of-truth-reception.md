People who are harmed by police brutality and family members of people killed by police are rarely provided with truth because incidents of police violence are not properly investigated. Even when the government claims they are conducting an investigation, it is designed to clear the police and ensure there will be no accountability.

Please join us for a reception and panel discussion on how to ensure that the truth about police incidents is available to victims and the community.
