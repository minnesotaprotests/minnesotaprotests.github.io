> This grassroots movement is calling for a national general strike on Feburary 17th, 2017 in defense of our nation’s constitution. Participants pledge to be non-violent. On the day of the strike, we will not go to work (unless absolutely necessary). We will not go to school (unless necessary). We will not spend any money (unless necessary). Instead, we will show dissent with unconstitutional governance through gatherings and activities to be organized at the local/personal level. Some communities are planning a day of service. Instead of work, strikers will dedicate their time to serving neighbors in need. Find your people. Make your plan. Spread the word…

Note: I haven't seen organized events in Minnesota yet, but when I do I'll put them here.
