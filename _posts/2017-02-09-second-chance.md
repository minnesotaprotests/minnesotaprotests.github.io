> Join over 60 Minnesota organizations! SECOND CHANCE DAY ON THE HILL Minnesota State Capitol Rotunda

> The most impactful way for you to influence the polices that impact you and those you care about is by meeting in person with your legislators. This year we will only be visiting legislators if we have a pre-scheduled meeting for at least one constituent. If you want to visit your legislators as part of Second Chance day on the Hill, please register by following this link.

> After you have registered, a visit will be arranged for you, if possible, with your legislators and an experienced Second Chance Coalition visit leader. You will be contacted with the time and details. Most visits will be scheduled in the late morning after the rally or early afternoon.

> Between the hundreds that show up to the rally, and the visits that happen, this is the greatest way to show our law makers that Second Chances are important for ALL Minnesotans! Join us!
