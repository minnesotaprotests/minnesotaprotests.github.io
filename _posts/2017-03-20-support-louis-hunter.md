DROP THE CHARGES! 3/20 Press conference, court support & call-in for Louis Hunter

Louis Hunter is facing felony charges and serious time for participating in a protest of the police murder of his cousin, Philando Castile. He faces 2 counts of 2nd degree riot while armed with a dangerous weapon, up to 10 years in prison, and a $20k fine. If convicted, Louis faces as much time in prison as the cop who murdered Philando. These charges are trumped up and unjust! Louis' family is grieving and has been through too much already. Now, in addition to supporting his family in this difficult time, he is preparing to defend himself in court. Acting in solidarity with Louis is paramount to continuing the struggle for black lives right now.


You can support Louis Hunter with these actions on Monday, 3/20.


1. Call Carver County Attorney Mark Metz and demand he DROP THE CHARGES!
Although Louis' case is proceeding in Ramsey County court, it is being prosecuted by someone from the Carver County Attorney's office. Call Carver County Attorney Mark Metz on Monday, 3/20, at (952) 361-1400; you can use the script below or your own words:


“My name is XXX and I’m calling to demand that the charges against Philando Castile’s cousin Louis Hunter be dropped. His protest was in response to a tragic loss of life and his legitimate outrage should not be criminalized.”

2. Attend the press conference and pack the courtroom for Louis' next hearing!
Help show Louis and the public that we have his back, and show the State that we won't back down! Come to the Ramsey County Courthouse at 15 W. Kellogg in Downtown St. Paul on Monday, 3/20. Gather at 12:00 and press conference at 12:30. After the press conference, help us pack the courtroom for Louis' hearing at 1:30. Please wear black & gold to show solidarity.
