> Please come and walk with us for love; love for your immigrant neighbor, love for your Muslim classmate, love for your Syrian restaurant owner, love for your Somali state representative, love for your Mexican friend, above all, love for humanity. Bring love notes and letters of hope, and let’s fill Minneapolis with love signs and love marks at a time that hate is forced upon us. Let’s show our love for humanity and stand by our immigrant communities who are in fear for their existence and losing their hopes to be reunited with their loved ones. 

> We will start our walk of love from Downtown Minneapolis, City Hall and end at the University of Minnesota West Bank, Washington Ave Pedestrian Bridge; where we will write our love notes and build a bridge of love. Amirah Sackett, "We're Muslim, Don't Panic" will be also performing at this event.
