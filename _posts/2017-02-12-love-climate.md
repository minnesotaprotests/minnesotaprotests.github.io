"This Valentineâ€™s Day, share your love for our world with U.S. Bank CEO Richard Davis. Mr. Davis claims to take the science of climate change seriously, yet is publicly supporting Donald Trump, whose policies seek to withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement, reinstate the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and gut the EPA."
