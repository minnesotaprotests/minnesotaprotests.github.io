From 9:30 AM until 11:30 AM we have Room G23 in the Capitol reserved for gathering, an ERA Briefing, and sending folks out in teams to do Legislator Visits/Visibility throughout the Capitol Complex. At 11:30 AM folks are invited to join women legislators and staff members on the Capitol Steps for a group photo to be shared with press/media. Then at Noon we will meet in front of both the House & Senate Chambers, and we will send notes to our legislators to meet individually with us to discuss pending legislation before both chambers.
