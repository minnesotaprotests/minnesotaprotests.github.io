1,000 who CAIR, a Call to Action: Challenging Islamophobia/Defending Civil Rights will be a rallying cry to all who believe in religious freedom for Muslim Americans and all people. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, Minnesota is hosting this event not only as a fundraiser/conference, but as a kick-off to its campaign to activate 10,000 Minnesotans in the fight against bigotry and hatred. The event will feature noted Muslim scholar Dalia Mogahed, Khizr Khan, Rep.. Ilhan Omar, Civil Rights Leader Nekima Levy-Pounds and many other politicians and entertainers such as comedians Jeremy McLellan and Danish Maqbool to inspire and energize people into ACTION.
