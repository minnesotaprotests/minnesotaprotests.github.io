This Earth Day, April 22nd, kids will take to the streets and march for climate justice!

Why? Because young people know climate change is real.<br />
They know it is human caused.<br />
They know their future is at stake.<br />
They are insistent that our leadership take action.<br />
And they are not interested in excuses.<br />

The Kids Climate March is co-hosted by iMatter, Climate Action Kids and Climate Generation, and is partnering with the March for Science Minnesota happening that same day. Our marches will merge and proceed to the Capitol together, with the kids leading the march.
