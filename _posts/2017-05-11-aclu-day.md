You are invited to join the ACLU of Minnesota for its 2017 Day at the Capitol on May 11! We hope you can join us for this exciting day. The Day at the Hill will start with a rally at the rotunda, which will include speakers talking about important civil liberties issues affecting Minnesotans. After the rally, there may be an opportunity to observe one or both of the legislative bodies in session and potentially speak with your legislators in person.
