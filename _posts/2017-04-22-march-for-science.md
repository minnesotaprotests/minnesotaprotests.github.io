On April 22, a coalition of Minnesotans from all professions and all walks of life, various non-profits, labor unions, and religious groups are marching on the state capitol to show support of higher education and the discovery, access, and understanding of scientific information. We are working to protect and defend science funding, regulatory agencies, and evidence based policy-making in recognition that science plays a vital role in the progress and sustainability of society. Join us!

March will start at Cathedral Hill Park at 11 am.

Rally at the Minnesota State Capitol at 12 noon.

Marchers are encouraged to wear blue and green.
