With the new change in administration and the threat of anti-Muslim policies, it is critical that Muslims make their voice heard to their legislators. Today, more than ever, Minnesota Muslims need advocates willing to help protect our constitutional rights. 

Register now for the 13th Annual Muslim Day at Capitol on Wednesday, March 29th, 2017 from 9:00 - 3:00.
