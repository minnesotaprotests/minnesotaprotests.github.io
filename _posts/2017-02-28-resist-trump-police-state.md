When Trump says "Make America Great Again," he is talking rolling back the calendar, undoing decades of struggle against racism and white supremacy. His campaign inspired people like Lance Scarsella, who shot five Black men protesting for justice for Jamar, and there have been more hate crimes since he was elected. Trump’s administration is filled with super-racists and praised by the KKK and the American Nazi Party. Now he’s signing one Executive Order that will flood our communities with more police, and another that directs the Department of Justice to act against the movement against police crimes.
