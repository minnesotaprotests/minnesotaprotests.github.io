We are hosting our first vigil for Erik Paulsen's Lack of Courage.

It has been 99 days since Trump took office, and not one of those days did Erik Paulsen stand up to Trump with his votes.

Plan to gather at Erik's office building as it nears sunset with (electric tealight) candles, and we will mourn for our lack of true representation.

Candles will be available, but feel free to bring your own as well. *Note* - no candles will be lit because, you know, fire hazard.
