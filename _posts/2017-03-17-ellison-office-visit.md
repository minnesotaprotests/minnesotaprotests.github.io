Join us on St. Patrick's Day as we visit Keith Ellison's office and urge him not to leave our health to luck! We would like to thank Representative Ellison for his leadership and share with him some stories about how his constituents will be affected if the Trump administration and his GOP allies in Congress are successful in repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Tentatively planned for 4:00pm-5:00pm, but it may be changed if we are successful in scheduling a specific meeting time with the Congressman.
