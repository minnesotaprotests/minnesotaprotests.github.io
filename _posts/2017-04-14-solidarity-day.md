Every year on Good Friday, thousands of anti-Planned Parenthood protesters descend on the Planned Parenthood clinic at Vandalia Street in St. Paul. This is your chance to show up, speak up, and stand up for the patients that count on Planned Parenthood. Join Planned Parenthood supporters beginning at 10 a.m. for a peaceful counter protest to make sure everyone knows that Planned Parenthood is here for good.
