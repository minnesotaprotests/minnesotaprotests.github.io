This April 29th join us for a People's Climate March solidarity event in the Twin Cities.
The People's Climate March (2.0) is happening in Washington DC to challenge the backwards and dangerous policies of the Trump Administration and the threat they pose to our climate and our communities.

This is a moment to bring the range of progressive social change movements together. Pushing back against the Trump agenda and at the same time pushing forward on our vision of a clean, safe world where the rights of all people are protected and expanded means we all must work together.

Join us on and march on April 29th as we resist, build, and rise in the face of the threats to our communities. We'll be starting at 2:30pm at the Federal Courthouse Building in downtown Minneapolis for a rally and march through downtown, over the Stone Arch Bridge to Father Hennepin Bluff Park. We will share more details as they emerge.
