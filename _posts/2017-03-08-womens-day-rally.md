Let's mark the day by recognizing the enormous value that women add to our socioeconomic system – all while receiving lower wages, experiencing vulnerability to discrimination, sexual harassment, and job insecurity

Let's stand together for equity, justice and the human rights of women and all who are gender-oppressed. Join us and wear RED for a group photo to be sent to our representatives!

We’ll be distributing a list of local women-owned businesses to support.
