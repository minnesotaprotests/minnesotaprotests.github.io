Please join me for a town hall discussion on climate change on Thursday, Feb. 23 in the James B. Woulfe Alumni Hall on the campus of the University of St. Thomas.

The town hall, which will include St. Thomas School of Engineering Professor Dr. John Abraham as a special guest, will address how we can continue acting on climate change in the face of the Trump administration’s anti-science, pro-fossil fuel stance.

President Donald Trump has called climate change a ‘hoax’ perpetrated by the Chinese and the Republican Congress wants to tear up environmental protections like the Clean Power Plan. Our discussion will focus on what we all can do to act on climate change and protect our planet from its most devastating impacts.

The town hall is free and open to the public. No RSVP is required. James B. Woulfe Alumni Hall is located on the 3rd Floor of the Anderson Student Center on the campus of the University of St. Thomas, located at 2115 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota 55105.
