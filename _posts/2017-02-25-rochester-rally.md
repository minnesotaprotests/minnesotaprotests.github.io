We will gather to show our support for affordable, quality healthcare for Americans of every age and health status. 

This event will begin with the talented LaSonya Kline Fleming singing the National Anthem. 

Speakers: 

Representative Tina Liebling
Representative Duane Sauke
Dr. Mark Liebow, Physician @ Mayo Clinic

We also will have a couple of filmmakers in attendance who will be making a shareable video. If you want to share your thoughts look for one of them for an on camera interview.

Rally sponsored by Stand Up SE Minnesota and local citizens.
