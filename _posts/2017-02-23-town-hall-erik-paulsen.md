With or without Rep. Erik Paulsen, it's time for a community meeting. After many, many requests and invitations, we need to get to the business of his addressing our community concerns. He can't do it without talking to us. 

Join us! If Rep. Paulsen chooses not to attend, we'll review his voting record and public positions. We'll record our questions and concerns and share them with Rep. Paulsen and the media.
