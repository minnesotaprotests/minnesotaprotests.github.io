How do we protect our community from police violence? What does the fight for justice look like today? We are calling for a community discussion of how to confront police crimes. Please join us, share your ideas and experiences, so we can all learn from eachother and take action together.

We'll provide snacks AND childcare.
If you will bring or might bring your kids, try let us know so we can plan for them! (requested not required)
