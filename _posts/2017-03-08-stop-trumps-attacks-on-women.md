President Trump is sexual predator and misogynist. For over 100 years, fighters for women’s liberation worldwide have been standing up to buffoons like Trump and his followers - on March 8, International Women’s Day.

...

Around the word on March 8, women are striking, marching and protesting. Join with us here in the Twin Cities to say that we will NOT go back, we will fight back!
