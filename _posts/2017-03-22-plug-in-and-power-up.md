Wondering how you can infuse political action into your everyday routine? We're hosting an interactive session to help you do just that--and help elect pro-choice women in the process.

Join womenwinning and Katie Gjertson for our second Plug In & Power Up event on Wednesday, March 22.

Come learn how to become a top-notch campaign volunteer and canvasser--and a better citizen!--by learning how to have critical conversations about the issues that matter to you. You'll also hear about upcoming opportunities to support womenwinning endorsed candidates through direct action.

We’re here to break down the barriers that keep people from engaging in the political process. Join us if you’re ready to act!


PLEASE NOTE: Space is limited for this event. Prior RSVP is reuired and admittance will be on a first come first served basis.
